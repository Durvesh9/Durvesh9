# Hi, I’m Durvesh 👋

I'm a Data Analyst / AI & ML graduate (B.E. 2025) building data-driven products and analytics solutions. I focus on bridging **data**, **engineering**, and **business** — delivering clean analysis, reproducible Python models, and user-friendly Excel dashboards.

---

## 🔭 What I do
- Build end-to-end analytics solutions: data ingestion → modelling → validation → dashboards.
- Implement ML & statistical models for behavioral analysis, forecasting, and product analytics.
- Create reproducible Python packages and Excel-based UAT workbooks for client validation.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
**Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
**Data & ML:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
**Visualization & BI:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI  
**Web & DevOps:** Django, React basics, Git, Docker (basic)  
**Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL (basics)  
**Collaboration:** Jira, Confluence, VS Code

*If you'd like, I can convert this into a fully-styled `README.md` with badges, GitHub stats widgets and animated GIFs for project demos. Tell me what tone you prefer (formal / friendly / minimal) and I'll update it.*

## 🔧 Added: GitHub Stats Badges & Language Card
I've added ready-to-use **GitHub stats badges** and a **Top Languages card** section into this README. These use the popular `github-readme-stats` service and are dynamic — they update automatically with your GitHub activity.

**Badges included (examples):**
- GitHub stats card (total stars, commits, PRs):
```
![Durvesh's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Durvesh9&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=radical)
```

- Top languages card:
```
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Durvesh9&layout=compact&theme=radical)
```

> Tip: switch `theme=radical` to `theme=dark` or `theme=default` depending on the look you prefer.

---

## 📦 Downloadable README.md and ZIP
I created a ready-to-use `README.md` (with badges, projects, contact info) and packaged it into a ZIP file for you to download, edit locally, and push to GitHub. See the chat for the download link.

---

## 📌 Implementation steps (how to put this on your GitHub profile)
1. Create a new **public** repository with the exact name of your GitHub username (`Durvesh9`).
2. Add the generated `README.md` file to the repo root and commit.
3. Push to GitHub. Once the repo exists and contains a README, GitHub will show it on your profile page automatically.

**Quick Git commands** (run in the folder containing README.md):
```bash
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: add profile README"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Durvesh9/Durvesh9.git
git push -u origin main
```

4. To update badges (if needed) or change theme, edit the README and push again.

---

If you want, I can now:
- change the badge theme (dark / light / anime / radical),
- add more widgets (streaks, trophies, visitor badge), or
- auto-create a ZIP containing your other repos' READMEs (requires repo content). 

Tell me which theme and widgets you prefer and I’ll update the canvas and regenerate files.
